# Basic-Web-Development
Day 1 of web dev! Getting comfy with HTML, CSS &amp; JS. Built a basic page: headings, text, image, link. Styled with colors, fonts, spacing. Added a button that alerts!
My goals for today's learning and application:

HTML Structure: Building a basic webpage with essential elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
CSS Styling: Learning to apply visual flair with colors, fonts, spacing, and basic layout.
JavaScript Interaction: Implementing a simple button that triggers an alert to understand basic interactivity.
This repository will track my progress as I learn and apply these foundational concepts. Excited to see what I can build!
